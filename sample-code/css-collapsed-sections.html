    Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry
    Sanger.<sup>[13]</sup> Sanger coined its name,<sup>[14][15]</sup> as a portmanteau of "wiki"
    (the Hawaiian word for "quick"<sup>[16]</sup>) and "encyclopedia". While it was
    Initially an English-language encyclopedia, versions in other languages
    were quickly developed. With at least 5,972,764 articles,<sup>[note 3]</sup> the
    English Wikipedia is the largest of the more than 290 Wikipedia
    encyclopedias. Overall, Wikipedia comprises more than 40 million
    articles in 301 different languages<sup>[17]</sup> and by February 2014 it had
    reached 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors
    per month.<sup>[18]</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2005, <i>Nature</i> published a peer review comparing 42 hard science
    articles from <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i> and Wikipedia and found that
    Wikipedia's level of accuracy approached that of <i>Britannica</i>,<sup>[19]</sup>
    although critics suggested that it might not have fared so well in a similar
    study of a random sampling of all articles or one focused on social science
    or contentious social issues.<sup>[20][21]</sup> The following year,
    <i>Time</i> magazine stated that the open-door policy of allowing anyone
    to edit had made Wikipedia the biggest and possibly the best encyclopedia
    in the world, and was a testament to the vision of Jimmy Wales.<sup>[22]</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    Wikipedia has been criticized for exhibiting systemic bias, for presenting
    a mixture of "truth, half truth, and some falsehoods",<sup>[23]</sup> and
    for being subject to manipulation and spin in controversial topics.<sup>[24]</sup>
    In addition, Wikipedia has gender bias, particularly on its English-language
    site, where the dominant majority of editors are male. However, Edit-a-thons
    have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of
    women's topics.<sup>[25][26]</sup> Facebook announced that by 2017 it would
    help readers detect fake news by suggesting links to related Wikipedia
    articles. YouTube announced a similar plan in 2018.<sup>[27]</sup>

    <div class=note>
      Main article: Nupedia
    </div>
    <p>
      Other collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before Wikipedia,
      but none were as successful.<sup>[28]</sup> Wikipedia began as a
      complementary project for Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia
      project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal
      process.<sup>[29]</sup> It was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership
      of Bomis, a web portal company. Its main figures were Bomis CEO Jimmy Wales
      and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia.<sup>[30][31]</sup>
      Nupedia was initially licensed under its own Nupedia Open Content License,
      but even before Wikipedia was founded, Nupedia switched to the GNU Free
      Documentation License at the urging of Richard Stallman.<sup>[32]</sup> Wales
      is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia,
      <sup>[33][34]</sup> while Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki
      to reach that goal.<sup>[35]</sup> On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the
      Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a "feeder" project for Nupedia.<sup>[36]</sup>
    </p>
    <h3>Launch and early growth</h3>
    <p>
      The domains wikipedia.com and wikipedia.org were registered on January
      12, 2001<sup>[37]</sup> and January 13, 2001<sup>[38]</sup>
      respectively, and Wikipedia was launched on January 15,
      2001,<sup>[29]</sup> as a single English-language edition at
      www.wikipedia.com,<sup>[39]</sup> and announced by Sanger on the
      Nupedia mailing list.<sup>[33]</sup> Wikipedia's policy of "neutral
      point-of-view"<sup>[40]</sup> was codified in its first few months.
      Otherwise, there were relatively few rules initially and Wikipedia
      operated independently of Nupedia.<sup>[33]</sup> Originally, Bomis
      intended to make Wikipedia a business for profit.<sup>[41]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, Slashdot postings,
      and web search engine indexing. Language editions were also created,
      with a total of 161 by the end of 2004.<sup>[42]</sup> Nupedia and
      Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers were taken down
      permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia. The
      English Wikipedia passed the mark of two million articles on September
      9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, surpassing
      the 1408 Yongle Encyclopedia, which had held the record for almost
      600 years.<sup>[43]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      Citing fears of commercial advertising and lack of control in
      Wikipedia, users of the Spanish Wikipedia forked from Wikipedia to
      create the Enciclopedia Libre in February 2002.<sup>[44]</sup> These
      moves encouraged Wales to announce that Wikipedia would not display
      advertisements, and to change Wikipedia's domain from wikipedia.com to
      wikipedia.org.<sup>[45]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the English Wikipedia reached three million articles in August
      2009, the growth of the edition, in terms of the numbers of new
      articles and of contributors, appears to have peaked around early
      2007.<sup>[46]</sup> Around 1,800 articles were added daily to the
      encyclopedia in 2006; by 2013 that average was roughly
      800.<sup>[47]</sup> A team at the Palo Alto Research Center attributed
      this slowing of growth to the project's increasing exclusivity and
      resistance to change.<sup>[48]</sup> Others suggest that the growth is
      flattening naturally because articles that could be called
      "low-hanging fruit"—topics that clearly merit an article—have already
      been created and built up extensively.<sup>[49][50][51]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      In November 2009, a researcher at the Rey Juan Carlos University in
      Madrid found that the English Wikipedia had lost 49,000 editors during
      the first three months of 2009; in comparison, the project lost only
      4,900 editors during the same period in 2008.<sup>[52][53]</sup> The
      Wall Street Journal cited the array of rules applied to editing and
      disputes related to such content among the reasons for this
      trend.<sup>[54]</sup> Wales disputed these claims in 2009, denying the
      decline and questioning the methodology of the study.<sup>[55]</sup>
      Two years later, in 2011, Wales acknowledged the presence of a slight
      decline, noting a decrease from "a little more than 36,000 writers" in
      June 2010 to 35,800 in June 2011. In the same interview, Wales also
      claimed the number of editors was "stable and
      sustainable".<sup>[56]</sup> A 2013 article titled "The Decline of
      Wikipedia" in MIT's Technology Review questioned this claim. The
      article revealed that since 2007, Wikipedia had lost a third of its
      volunteer editors, and those still there have focused increasingly on
      minutiae.<sup>[57]</sup> In July 2012, The Atlantic reported that the
      number of administrators is also in decline.<sup>[58]</sup> In the
      November 25, 2013, issue of New York magazine, Katherine Ward stated
      "Wikipedia, the sixth-most-used website, is facing an internal
      crisis".<sup>[59]</sup>
    </p>
    <h3>Milestones</h3>
    <p>
      In January 2007, Wikipedia entered for the first time the top-ten list
      of the most popular websites in the US, according to comScore
      Networks. With 42.9 million unique visitors, Wikipedia was ranked
      number 9, surpassing The New York Times (#10) and Apple (#11). This
      marked a significant increase over January 2006, when the rank was
      number 33, with Wikipedia receiving around 18.3 million unique
      visitors.<sup>[60]</sup> As of September 2019, Wikipedia has rank
      9<sup>[8]</sup> among websites in terms of popularity according to
      Alexa Internet. In 2014, it received 8 billion pageviews every
      month.<sup>[61]</sup> On February 9, 2014, The New York Times reported
      that Wikipedia has 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique
      visitors a month, "according to the ratings firm
      comScore."<sup>[18]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      On January 18, 2012, the English Wikipedia participated in a series of
      coordinated protests against two proposed laws in the United States
      Congress—the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act
      (PIPA)—by blacking out its pages for 24 hours.<sup>[62]</sup> More
      than 162 million people viewed the blackout explanation page that
      temporarily replaced Wikipedia content.<sup>[63][64]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      Loveland and Reagle argue that, in process, Wikipedia follows a long
      tradition of historical encyclopedias that accumulated improvements
      piecemeal through "stigmergic accumulation".<sup>[65][66]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      On January 20, 2014, Subodh Varma reporting for The Economic Times
      indicated that not only had Wikipedia's growth stalled, but that it
      "had lost nearly 10 per cent of its page views last year. There was a
      decline of about 2 billion between December 2012 and December 2013.
      Its most popular versions are leading the slide: page-views of the
      English Wikipedia declined by 12 per cent, those of German version
      slid by 17 per cent and the Japanese version lost 9 per
      cent."<sup>[67]</sup> Varma added that, "While Wikipedia's managers
      think that this could be due to errors in counting, other experts feel
      that Google's Knowledge Graphs project launched last year may be
      gobbling up Wikipedia users."<sup>[67]</sup> When contacted on this
      matter, Clay Shirky, associate professor at New York University and
      fellow at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Security indicated
      that he suspected much of the page view decline was due to Knowledge
      Graphs, stating, "If you can get your question answered from the
      search page, you don't need to click [any further]."<sup>[67]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of December 2016, Wikipedia was ranked fifth in the most
      popular websites globally.<sup>[68]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      In January 2013, 274301 Wikipedia, an asteroid, was named after
      Wikipedia; in October 2014, Wikipedia was honored with the Wikipedia
      Monument; and, in July 2015, Wikipedia became available as 7,473 books
      for $500,000. In 2019, a species of flowering plant was named Viola
      wikipedia.<sup>[69]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      In April 2019, an etched copy of Wikipedia is now on the Moon after
      surviving a crash landing of Beresheet, a failed Israeli lunar lander,
      according to experts.<sup>[70][71]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      In June 2019, scientists reported that all 16 GB of Wikipedia have
      been encoded into synthetic DNA.<sup>[72]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      On November 17, 2019, Christina Koch made the first confirmed edit to
      Wikipedia from space while aboard the International Space
      Station.<sup>[73]</sup>

      Unlike traditional encyclopedias, Wikipedia follows the
      procrastination principle<sup>[note 4][75]</sup> regarding the
      security of its content.<sup>[75]</sup> It started almost entirely
      open—anyone could create articles, and any Wikipedia article could be
      edited by any reader, even those who did not have a Wikipedia account.
      Modifications to all articles would be published immediately. As a
      result, any article could contain inaccuracies such as errors,
      ideological biases, and nonsensical or irrelevant text.
    </p>
    <h3>Restrictions</h3>
    <p>
      Due to the increasing popularity of Wikipedia, some editions,
      including the English version, have introduced editing restrictions in
      some cases. For instance, on the English Wikipedia and some other
      language editions, only registered users may create a new
      article.<sup>[76]</sup> On the English Wikipedia, among others, some
      particularly controversial, sensitive and/or vandalism-prone pages
      have been protected to some degree.<sup>[77][78]</sup> A frequently
      vandalized article can be semi-protected or extended confirmed
      protected, meaning that only autoconfirmed or extended confirmed
      editors are able to modify it.<sup>[79]</sup> A particularly
      contentious article may be locked so that only administrators are able
      to make changes.<sup>[80]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      In certain cases, all editors are allowed to submit modifications, but
      review is required for some editors, depending on certain conditions.
      For example, the German Wikipedia maintains "stable versions" of
      articles,<sup>[81]</sup> which have passed certain reviews. Following
      protracted trials and community discussion, the English Wikipedia
      introduced the "pending changes" system in December
      2012.<sup>[82]</sup> Under this system, new and unregistered users'
      edits to certain controversial or vandalism-prone articles are
      reviewed by established users before they are
      published.<sup>[83]</sup>
    </p>
    <h3>Review of changes</h3>
    <p>
      Although changes are not systematically reviewed, the software that
      powers Wikipedia provides certain tools allowing anyone to review
      changes made by others. The "History" page of each article links to
      each revision.[note 5]<sup>[84]</sup> On most articles, anyone can
      undo others' changes by clicking a link on the article's history page.
      Anyone can view the latest changes to articles, and anyone may
      maintain a "watchlist" of articles that interest them so they can be
      notified of any changes. "New pages patrol" is a process whereby newly
      created articles are checked for obvious problems.<sup>[85]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2003, economics PhD student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low
      transaction costs of participating in a wiki create a catalyst for
      collaborative development, and that features such as allowing easy
      access to past versions of a page favor "creative construction" over
      "creative destruction".<sup>[86]</sup>
    </p>
    <h3>Vandalism</h3>
    <p>
      Any change or edit that manipulates content in a way that purposefully
      compromises the integrity of Wikipedia is considered vandalism. The
      most common and obvious types of vandalism include additions of
      obscenities and crude humor. Vandalism can also include advertising
      and other types of spam.<sup>[87]</sup> Sometimes editors commit
      vandalism by removing content or entirely blanking a given page. Less
      common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of
      plausible but false information to an article can be more difficult to
      detect. Vandals can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page
      semantics such as the page's title or categorization, manipulate the
      underlying code of an article, or use images
      disruptively.<sup>[88]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      Obvious vandalism is generally easy to remove from Wikipedia articles;
      the median time to detect and fix vandalism is a few
      minutes.<sup>[89][90]</sup> However, some vandalism takes much longer
      to repair.<sup>[91]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Seigenthaler biography incident, an anonymous editor introduced
      false information into the biography of American political figure John
      Seigenthaler in May 2005. Seigenthaler was falsely presented as a
      suspect in the assassination of John F. Kennedy.<sup>[91]</sup> The
      article remained uncorrected for four months.<sup>[91]</sup>
      Seigenthaler, the founding editorial director of USA Today and founder
      of the Freedom Forum First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University,
      called Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales and asked whether he had any
      way of knowing who contributed the misinformation. Wales replied that
      he did not, although the perpetrator was eventually
      traced.<sup>[92][93]</sup> After the incident, Seigenthaler described
      Wikipedia as "a flawed and irresponsible research
      tool".<sup>[91]</sup> This incident led to policy changes at
      Wikipedia, specifically targeted at tightening up the verifiability of
      biographical articles of living people.<sup>[94]</sup>
    </p>
    <h3>Edit warring</h3>
    <p>
      Wikipedians often have disputes regarding content, which may result in
      repeatedly making opposite changes to an article, known as "edit
      warring".<sup>[95][96]</sup> The process is a resource-consuming
      scenario where no useful knowledge is added.<sup>[97]</sup> This
      practice is also criticized as creating a competitive,<sup>[98]</sup>
      conflict based<sup>[99]</sup> editing culture associated with
      traditional masculine gender roles,<sup>[100]</sup> which contributes
      to the gender bias on Wikipedia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Special interest groups have engaged in edit wars to advance their own
      political interests. Defending Israeli settlements in the West Bank,
      numerous pro-occupation groups have launched "Zionist editing"
      campaigns.<sup>[101]</sup> In 2010, the then director general of the
      Yesha Council and former Israeli Cabinet Minister Naftali Bennett
      described their goal "as not to make Wikipedia rightist but for it to
      include our point of view".<sup>[102]</sup>

      Content in Wikipedia is subject to the laws (in particular, copyright
      laws) of the United States and of the US state of Virginia, where the
      majority of Wikipedia's servers are located. Beyond legal matters, the
      editorial principles of Wikipedia are embodied in the "five pillars"
      and in numerous policies and guidelines intended to appropriately
      shape content. Even these rules are stored in wiki form, and Wikipedia
      editors write and revise the website's policies and
      guidelines.<sup>[103]</sup> Editors can enforce these rules by
      deleting or modifying non-compliant material. Originally, rules on the
      non-English editions of Wikipedia were based on a translation of the
      rules for the English Wikipedia. They have since diverged to some
      extent.<sup>[81]</sup>
    </p>
    <h3>Content policies and guidelines</h3>
    <p>
      According to the rules on the English Wikipedia, each entry in
      Wikipedia must be about a topic that is encyclopedic and is not a
      dictionary entry or dictionary-like.<sup>[104]</sup> A topic should
      also meet Wikipedia's standards of "notability",<sup>[105]</sup> which
      generally means that the topic must have been covered in mainstream
      media or major academic journal sources that are independent of the
      article's subject. Further, Wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge
      that is already established and recognized.<sup>[106]</sup> It must
      not present original research. A claim that is likely to be challenged
      requires a reference to a reliable source. Among Wikipedia editors,
      this is often phrased as "verifiability, not truth" to express the
      idea that the readers, not the encyclopedia, are ultimately
      responsible for checking the truthfulness of the articles and making
      their own interpretations.<sup>[107]</sup> This can at times lead to
      the removal of information that, though valid, is not properly
      sourced.<sup>[108]</sup> Finally, Wikipedia must not take
      sides.<sup>[109]</sup> All opinions and viewpoints, if attributable to
      external sources, must enjoy an appropriate share of coverage within
      an article. This is known as neutral point of view (NPOV).
